## Design
My interface exposes Station data by displaying the locations of all stations on a map, as well as providing a searchable list to find stations by name, address, city, state, or zip code. Clicking on markers or station names in the list will open a popup on the map with detail and zoom in. All functionality is done in the frontend with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Technologies Used
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/): Displays the map and markers of where all the stations are located
- [List.js](http://listjs.com/): Creates a sortable and searchable list of stations
